**Assumption**: A Java application being developed by a team of 6 people.

VS Code provides a Formatter with formatting settings that allows the team to format their Java files. SonarLint is useful for checking source code quality and security issues.

For testing, JUnit would be the first choice.

For Java applications, besides GitHub Actions and Jenkins, Maven, TeamCity, Atlassian Bamboo / BitBucket Pipelines, Azure DevOps and Amazon AWS are the other great CI/CD solutions that have been popular for many years.

Deciding if the application should be deployed to a self-hosted or a cloud-based environment would depend on the size of the application.
